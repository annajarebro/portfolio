            <h2 class="project_h2">My design approach</h2>
            <p>The scope of this project was to choose a website, analyze the current UI, and make a redesign. After analyzing the existing site, I formulated the design goal: Create a clear overview of what the company offers in a way that’s inspiring and easy to navigate. One of the main difficulties to overcome was designing with a goal-directed approach without having any direct contact with the company or their users. To solve this problem, I dug around on social media and travel sites to look at reviews and comments. Through this, I started to map out who their customers are and what their goal of visiting the website could be. </p>

         <div class="content_text users" id="content_users">
            <h2 class="project_h2">The users</h2>
            <p>I prefer to use behaivoral personas rather than demographic ones. Personally, I think personas based one behaivour says a lot more about the goals the user might have.
                For this project I worked toward three main behaivours:
                <br><br>
               <strong>The Tourists:</strong> Who wants to book an activity for the entire family that's available on the specific dates they're visiting.
                <br><br>
               <strong>The Bear Grylls:</strong> Who wants to dig deep into a specific course and for example book bushcraft basics.
                <br><br>
              <strong>The team builders: </strong> Who wishes to make a request for a tailord activity for a larger group of people.

        <div class="text_project text_wider">
            <h2 class="project_h2 ">Wireframes</h2>
            <p> To plan the structure and content of the website I began with sketching low fidelity wireframes. Then moving on to build digital wireframs that evolved until it reached a level of high fidelity. </p>

        <div class="text_project text_wider">
            <h2 class="project_h2">The fonts</h2>
            <p>When choosing fonts, the goal was to enhance the outdoor vibe and still make it clean and readable. Therefore I chose a combination of Cubano and Open Sans. Cubano was used for headings as the rounded edges and low crossbars gave the headings a heavy rustic outdoor vibe.   </p>

        <div class="text_project text_wider">
            <h2 class="project_h2">The colors</h2>
            <p> I wanted to embrace classical outdoor on the website. By using dark shades of green and orange, the colors get a more worn look. Just like that outdoor jacket you inherited from your grandpa that’s still going strong.</p>
