            <p>Returbo have a vision of making returns management easier, faster and help small business owners to take data driven decisions. Julia (founder), had been researching the field and saw an opportunity to develop a return management system for the Swedish market. Together with Fredrik (Developer) they had started to map out the basic user flow and integrated the needed back-end. This is where my design partner Lovisa and I joined the team. Our task was to transform this vision and user flow into a beta release version of the management portal and onboarding process.</p>

            <h2 class="h2-proj">Challenge: Integrate to the Shopify-eco system</h2>
            <p>Small shop owners tend to use commerce platforms to manage their businesses, which allows for customization through third-party apps. Since Returbo is nested inside the Shopify app, the first challenge was to ensure that the interface worked with the already existing Shopify interface. As well as making sure that the experience of switching between Shopify and turbo was seamless yet distinct. After some exploration, we found that a horizontal menu was preferred to utilize screen estate. Manually searching for returns is a key feature in the current return management process. Therefore, we made sure to make it easy to access. </p>        </div>

            <h2 class="h2-proj">Administration should be effortless</h2>
            <p>Handling returns might not be the task that you dream of when starting an online shop. However, each return must be handled properly to maintain good customer relationships. To make browsing returns as easy as possible in the interface, frequently used values were placed at the edges and numerical values separated to avoid misreading. Lastly, a color-coding system can help to quickly create an overview of return statues.  </p>

        <div class="content tighter pad10">
            <h2 class="h2-proj">Prototype, Test and Iterate</h2>
            <p>Nice, we have a first draft of the entire flow but does it meet the requirements to go live? To test that, we created an interactive prototype that we tested with three shop owners. One of the findings was that for smaller online shops there is no standardized way of handling returns. To make Returbo work in their already existing workflow and avoid becoming just another unused app we added some customization options.  </p>

        <div class="content tighter pad10">
            <h2 class="h2-proj">High speed and short deadlines</h2>
            <p>Our goal was to integrate a beta version to customers within a few months and to have a continuous front-end development parallel to the design process. As this was a part-time gig in parallel with our master’s degree studies, we tend to work different hours. Therefore, it was important to be very explicit about thoughts and processes in the Figma file when handing over work internally in the design team or to the developer. </p>

            <h2 class="h2-proj">Results</h2>
            <p>Lovisa and I delivered high-fidelity mock-ups for the adim portal, settings, onboarding and initiated a design system for the company to use in their future work. As of today, the beta version is integrated to a few customers and will launch officially to all Shopify users next year! </p>
