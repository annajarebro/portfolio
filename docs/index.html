                    I started my design journey with a bachelor in Industrial Design and Engineering. The programme was focused on researching, defining and designing for user needs. We grew experts of working in project groups, however we mainly worked toward designing physical products or services. Then one sunny day here in Gothenburg, I started a course were we could tip our toes into the field of web based interaction design. It was love at first sight. So, after my bachelor I packed my bags and moved to China to study one semester Innovation and design at Tongji University and one semester frist√•ende courses from Sweden focusing on ux, webdesgin and HTML/CSS. When I got home, I persuade my masters degree within Interaction design and technology.
