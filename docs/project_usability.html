                <p class="text_project">Evaluate the usability and redesign Omni's IOS app (late 2018 version) using both theoretical and empirical measures and based on the ISO-definition of usability (ISO 9241-11). </p>

                    <h2 class="project_h2">Theoretical methods</h2>
                    <p>The project began with evaluating the usability of the existing app to map out potential problem areas. This was done with the following methods:

                    </p>
                    <ul class="list">
                        <li>Hierarchical task analysis (HTA</li>

                <div class="text_project">
                    <h2 class="project_h2">usability testing</h2>
                    <p>From the theoretical problem areas defined, we conducted a usability test. During the test the users were given different tasks to complete. The interaction was recorded, scripted, and analyzed. The users also answered questions and made a semantic evaluation of the app, which we used together with the users click-data (Yes, we did count every click on those videos ourselves. And no, we didn’t use a plug-in for it). </p>
