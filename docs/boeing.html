        <p>At Tongji, I had the opportunity to do a project for Boeing about <b> the future of food and beverage experience in airplanes</b>. The project aimed to research new possibilities with the food service on airplanes as Boeing is in the process of expanding its business in China. </p>

        <h2 class="h2-center">Project Overview</h2>
        <img src="/boeing_img/overview.jpg">
        <p>The project was mainly following the path of desk research, user research, and ideation, with some iterative loops and weekly feedback sessions. At the weekly presentations, we only had the whiteboard as a presentation tool. This was <b>really good practice in communicating results and pitching ideas</b> without hiding behind top-notch designed powerpoints. </p>

        <h2 class="h2-center pad10">User Research</h2>
        
 
<p>I did the project together with Kevin, an exchange student from the Netherlands. So the first problem we face was that <b>we had absolutely no contacts in China</b>, but we didn't let that kill our spirits. This project showed how far you get digging a bit within your own contacts. From thinking, we didn't know anyone in the flight business, we actually managed to get interviews with 8 different flight attendants/pilots. As all of our interviewees were located in Europe, Kevin and I kindly had to get up at 2 am to hold Skype interviews. By sharing the research with the other design teams, we were able to get a broad insight from Chinese passengers as well. Some of the insights from both the passenger and the attendant perspective are presented below.

    <h2 class="h2-center pad10">User Journey</h2>
    
  
<p>The next step was to create a user journey based on the findings to identify where in the process we could <b> find opportunities to make improvements</b> (marked with orange). This was also great since it forced us to go through all the necessary steps the flight attendant and passenger take while serving/being served food on the airplane.

    <h2 class="h2-center pad10">Join the crew</h2>


<p>Our concepts were based around the phrase "join the crew", where the passenger becomes a more active part of the process. The idea is based on the fact that we as consumers get more and more used to being a part of services. What started as IKEA's business model of DYI has grown into self-scanning cashiers and making your own orders at restaurants using QR-codes. We ended up presenting the three following concepts:</p>
