            <p>I've always loved being creative. At the same time, I'm also pretty good at math. This combination has continuously grown into a big passion for design, user experiences, and tech. It's also what finally made me end up here, in my last year of interaction design master's studies. I think one of my biggest strengths as a designer is my broad knowledge. I can take a project from the early stages of user studies to ideation, conceptualization, evaluation, and implementation. I'm used to working in diverse teams. I always strive to improve as a team member and I'm very interested in the factors that create a great team. </p>
