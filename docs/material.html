        <h2>Material Design Case Study</h2> 
        <p>I’m mostly using apple tech products. I’m working on a Mac, scrolling social media on an iPhone, and counting my steps on an Apple Watch. As a student, I can most of the time choose whether to design apps for Android and iOS. Weeeell, guess what... I will almost every time choose to design for iOS since I’m used to the design guidelines and interaction patterns. Recently this realization has been bothering me, being a nagging reminder every time I create a wireframe. Therefore, I decided to deep dive into material design guidelines. All illustrations are done by me, follow along!  </p>

        <h2>Layout</h2> 
        <p>Extra small screens (phones) have a 16dp margin and a 4 column layout, where the column width is relative. Elements are mostly aligned to an 8dp grid, but smaller elements (e.g. icons) can also be aligned to a 4dp grid. Side note: I find the arm length measurement quite funny. Who’s arm are we talking about really? For your knowledge, my arm length is ~59cm. </p>

        <h2>App Bar and FABs </h2> 
        <p>App bars (mobile only) can contain up to 5 actions (including FAB and a burger menu). The perk of the bottom app bar is that it's easy to reach. The Floating Action Button (FAB) also helps highlight the most important action. 

            The FAB is used for important constructive actions (e.g. start, share, add, edit) and comes in default and mini versions. The mini is used for smaller screens and when needed to create visual continuity (e.g. if other related elements are 40dp). FAB can also be used as speed dials and contain 3-6 related actions that quite nicely animates in on press. </p>
