        For my master's thesis, I collaborated with Hyperlab to explore how to increase engagement with traceability information in e-commerce. Hyperlab, being an e-commerce design agency with a strong interest in sustainability, was keen on understanding how to support sustainable brands and help them become more competitive.</p>

            <h2>The problem with sub-pages</h2>
            <p class="padding-top-xxsmall">  
             
                In e-commerce, sustainability information is usually found on a sub-page accompanied by a few generic labels on the product page. However, customers often overlook sustainability sub-pages, and labels stating e.g. "sustainable choice" is becoming ineffective for many consumers, as it has been linked to greenwashing. </p>

        <div class="single-col padding-top-large">
            <h2>Our goal</h2>
            <p class="padding-top-xxsmall"> Increase engagement with traceability information, making retailers with high transparency in their supply chain more competitive. To achieve this, we aimed to understand how to make customers engage with traceability information and how to present it in a way that makes sense to people and assists them in making purchasing decisions.  </p>

            <h2>My contribution</h2>
            <p class="padding-top-xxsmall"> 
                I wrote my thesis solo, so it was a fantastic project to build my designer stamina. I managed all aspects of planning and executiona and making decisions on when to move forward and when to go back and interate. I conducted a study involving 78 consumers and 2 communication experts to understand consumer needs and current pain points, utilizing methods such as surveys, interviews, and focus groups. I explored different design patterns and created and tested design concepts. </p>

            <p class="padding-top-xxsmall"> As I started to sync with developers, we realized that most of the explored features would not be possible to include in the beta version. We faced quite a few technical constraints regarding document uploading, synchronization to our platform, etc. So, most of what was inherited from early exploration was the idea of going for a table view to enable fast annotation. </p>

At first, we belived that only the parent folder name mattered. However, we came to realize that the person initiating the purchase of an insights platform often played the role of a "librarian" within their team, knowing the folder tree inside out. As a result, they used the file path as a quick reference for annotation. </p>
