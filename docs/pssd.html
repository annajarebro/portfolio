        <p>This project aimed to <b class="p-bold">provide healthy meals to low-income elderly people living alone in Shanghai, by utilizing food surpluses in the neighborhood</b>.  Our solution is called Foodpanion, but more on that later. The first step was to understand how the community food services currently work, the needs of the Elderly, and where we could find an opportunity in the market.  As a young person, not living alone with a low income (Okay CSN isn't a fortune, but you get the point) in Shanghai, this context was completely new to me.<b class="p-bold"> Not being able to draw from my own experience was a good practice in collecting enough insights and rely on the user research</b>.

        <h2 class="h2-center">User Research</h2>
        
        <p>We started our research by analyzing the current solution of community meal services. To do this, we visited community centers and canteens. The next step was to interview elderly persons in Shanghai. <b class="p-bold">A problem we faced</b> was that only half of the group could conduct the interviews since most elderly only speak Chinese. This forced us to discover how we could efficiently communicate results within the group to create a common understanding. <b class="p-bold">We solved this by</b> adding key findings to a white-board, have a continuous discussion, and use personas for both internal and external uses.  </p>

        <h2 class="h2-center pad10">Findings</h2>
        
 
<p>In Shanghai's current food delivery service system for the old, <b class="p-bold">the third-party operating companies are economically difficult to maintain in the long run</b>. <br><br>

    Newly retired people in the community often have spare time and good physical strength. Income is often quite low, and feelings of loneliness are common.  <br><br>
    
    
    <b class="p-bold">Old people who order food alone are generally lonely and are very willing to chat with others</b>, but have, except their children, no opportunities to communicate with other people.<br><br>
</p>

</div>
<div class="content tighter">
<h2 class="h2-center pad10">Our solution</h2>
        

<p>Our concept, Foodpanion, utilizes food surplus from supermarkets. As we cannot compete financially with other meal services, we found the opportunity to use <b class="p-bold">friendship over financial relationship</b>. Foodpanion is a sort of buddy program, where the essential is that you will meet and socialize over a subsidized meal based on surplus. This provides cheap meals for both user groups, as well as covering the social needs of otherwise quite lonely individuals.
