              <h2 class="project_h2">My design approach</h2>
            <p>The scope of this project was to choose a website, analyze the current UI, and make a redesign. After analyzing the existing site, I formulated the design goal: Create a clear overview of what the company offers in a way that’s inspiring and easy to navigate.  One of the main difficulties to overcome was designing with a goal-directed approach without having any direct contact with the company. To solve this problem,  I dug around on social media and travel sites to look at reviews and comments. Through this, I started to map out who their customers are and what their goal of visiting the website could be. </p>

            <p>I think in many cases that  , the bear grylls, and used to evaluate the design from different perspectives throughout the process.</p>

            <p>When choosing fonts, the goal was to enhance the outdoor vibe and still make it clean and readable. </p>

            <p> By using dark shades of green and orange the colours get a more worn look, like that outdoor jacket that you inherited from your grandpa that’s still going strong.</p>
