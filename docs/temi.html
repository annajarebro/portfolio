        <p>Temi is an intelligent home robot that stores it's data in a knowledge graph. The design department at Tongji University intended to use Temi as a lab assistant. <b> Our task was to visualize the knowledge graph of Temi and turn it into a user interface</b>. Before starting, we had the opportunity to try out and interact with a Temi robot to understand what it is capable of and how the interaction today worked.  </p>

        <h2 class="h2-center">Understanding Temi</h2>
        <img src="/Temi_img/kg-db.jpg">
        <p>The first step was to map out what kind of information the robot can store, how it is stored, and how we can use it to our advantage in our design. To better understand what information that could be withdrawn from the robot, we created a database to represent a mock-up of the KG. The database also allowed us to quickly check our scenarios later on in the process. </p>

        <h2 class="h2-center pad10">Understanding the context of use </h2>
        <img src="/Temi_img/storyboard.jpg">
 
<p>The project had a short timeframe, but you always have time to squeeze in some sort of user research. We started by mapping out the lab-area where Temi was supposed to move and talked to students and teachers to understand what their needs are and how Temi could be helpful. <b>A big challenge was how to approach privacy</b>. 
    We discussed a lot about what kind of data Temi should track without the user's knowledge, how to display data and pictures without feeling exploited as a user, and what data different kinds of users should have access to. From the research, we made <b>three different user scenarios from both student and teacher perspectives</b>. The scenario "Borrowing equipment" is illustrated in the picture above. </p>

    <h2 class="h2-center pad10">Low-fi Prototype</h2>
    
  
<p>We categorized seven different types of interfaces depending on the level of detail. After sketching we made a paper prototype to get some quick feedback from users. We made some improvements based on the results and used Keynote to create a low-fi prototype <b>Keynote worked surprisingly well to make simple interactive prototypes</b>. From the tests, we found that users only use voice as input if it is clearly indicated that it's possible (eg. with a symbol such as a microphone or sound waves). In the original design, the user had to go through the task interaction to change input that the robot misunderstood. However, the test showed that all users then tried to correct the information by interacting directly with the node. So we made some changes before ending up with a final design. </p>

<p>Some of the screen from the final design is shown below. The scenario for borrowing equipment can also be seen in <a href="#temi-anchor">the video</a> at the top of the page.  It was fun to be able to design for another culture than the one I'm used to. In China, playful cartoon-ish UI's are way more common than here. We tried to utilize this fact to add some personality to Temi.</p>
