            <p> The goal of this project was to evaluate the usability and redesign Omni's IOS app (2019 version) using
                both theoretical and
                empirical measures and based on the ISO-definition of usability (ISO 9241-11) </p>

            <h2 class="h2-proj">Omni: a news app</h2>
            <p> Omni is an app that collects news from different sources, and allow the users to personalize the app
                depending on their interests. Omni has won several prizes for their news site and was really setting the
                trend for clean and good looking news apps. That's exactly why we chose this app for this project. We
                wanted something that at first glance was perfectly tailored for their users, as it gave us the
                challenge to dig deep to find improvements.</p>

            <h2 class="h2-proj">Theoretical analysis</h2>
            <p> The project began by theoretically evaluating the usability of the existing app to map out potential
                problem areas. The evaluation was based on <b class="p-bold">HTA, PHEA</b> and <b
                    class="p-bold">cognitive walkthrough</b>. This allowed us to browse the app as users, trying to get
                a hint of where problem areas were most likely to be found. The results was used to create the tasks and
                intervew questions for the usability-test, so that the test would cover relevant topics.</p>

            <h2 class="h2-proj">Usability testing</h2>
            <p> From the theoretical problem areas defined, we conducted a usability test. During the test the users
                were given different tasks to complete.
                The interaction was recorded, scripted, and analyzed. The users also answered questions and made a
                semantic evaluation of the app, which we used together with the users click-data
                (Yes, we did count every click on those videos ourselves. And no, we didn’t use a plug-in for it).</p>

            <h2 class="h2-proj">Problems</h2>
            <p> The results showed that browsing news between different categories was no problem. However, the users
                did struggle with some of the settings when trying to tailor the app to their needs.
                The reason was an unclear hierarchy between elements and a lack of visual clarity.

            <h2 class="h2-proj">Redesign</h2>
            <p> The redesign focused on improving the use of specific functions, but we also made some overall changes
                to the visual appearance of the news feed. The prototype was tested with both between- and
                within-subjects. </p>

            <h2 class="h2-proj">Increased performance</h2>
            <p> The redesign made the number of users able to complete the given tasks increase from
                    an average of 60% to 100%. It also lowered the number of clicks needed to perform the tasks.
                One example illustrated below was the task to remove push notifications from a "Brexit", a topic the
                user previously saved. </p>

                        to be afraid to be quiet.
