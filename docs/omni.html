        <p>The goal of this project was to <b>evaluate the usability and redesign Omni's IOS app (late 2018 version)</b> using both theoretical and empirical measures and based on the ISO-definition of usability (ISO 9241-11). Omni is an app that collects news from different sources, and allow the users to personalize the app depending on their interests. 
 
            Omni has won several prizes for their news site and was really setting the trend for clean and good looking news apps. That's exactly why we chose this app for this project. We wanted something that at first glance was perfectly tailored for their users, as it gave us the challenge to dig deep to find improvements. 
             <b>I loved this project</b>, it was the first time during my bachelor we were allowed to design for digital rather than physical products. It sparked my interest in interaction design, which I am very thankful for. </p>

        <h2 class="h2-center">Theoretical Analysis</h2>
        <p>The project began by theoretically evaluating the usability of the existing app to map out potential problem areas. The evaluation was based on <b>HTA, PHEA</b> and <b>cognitive walkthrough</b>. This allowed us to browse the app as users, trying to get a hint of where problem areas were most likely to be found. The results was used to create the tasks and intervew questions for the usability-test, so that the test would cover relevant topics. </p>

        <h2 class="h2-center pad10">Usability testing</h2>
 
<p>From the theoretical problem areas defined, we conducted a usability test. During the test the users were given different tasks to complete. 
    The interaction was recorded, scripted, and analyzed. The users also answered questions and made a semantic evaluation of the app, which we used together with the users click-data 
    (Yes, we did count every click on those videos ourselves. And no, we didn’t use a plug-in for it). The results showed that browsing news between different categories was no problem. However, the users did struggle with some of the settings when trying to tailor the app to their needs. 
    The reason was an <b>unclear hierarchy between elements and a lack of visual clarity</b>. Some of the most recurring problems were: </p>

    <ul>
        
        <li>Remove push notifications on topics you follow</li>

        <li>Adjust push-settings</li>

    <h2 class="h2-center pad10">Wireframing</h2>
    <img src="/Omni_img/wireframe2.jpg">

<p>We ideated and sketched the first round of wireframes on paper. It was both fast, but it also allowed for better discussions when we worked simultaneously. When the new design's features were done,  we built an extensive XD replica of the app including our design changes. </p>

    <h2 class="h2-center pad10">Redesign</h2>
<img class="redesign-h" src="/Omni_img/redesign-op.jpg">

<p>The redesign focused on improving the use of specific functions, but we also made some overall changes to the visual appearance of the news feed. The prototype was tested with both between- and within-subjects.
    The redesign made the number of users able to complete the given tasks increase from an average of 60% to 100%. It also lowered the number of clicks needed to perform the tasks. One example illustrated below was the task to remove push notifications from a "Brexit", a topic the user previously saved.</p>

    <h2 class="h2-center pad10">Skills & Lesson learned </h2>
<div class="learning-li">
<ul>
    <li> I learned how to work well with XD and to create extensive prototypes</li> 
    <li> I improved my skill in holding interviews. Being mindful not to use leading questions and not to be afraid to be quiet. 
    </li>
   <li>I learned the importance of involving users in the design process to be able to make better design decisions</li>
    <li>I learned that even though evolving all team members in all stages of the project is good from a learning context (i.e. in school), it's not the most efficient way to work. </li>
