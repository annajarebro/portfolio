        <p class="mt-6 text-lg text-zinc-700 ">
            As a small startup, you do anything to serve your customers. Hand over your mess, and we'll take care of it.
            However, we can't manually handle all onboarding processes if our goal is to onboard customers at scale.

        <p class="mt-6 text-lg text-zinc-700 ">

            Stravito is an knowledge management platform
            used by market research teams at large enterprises like Burberry, Comcast, and Electrolux.
            During my time at
            Stravito I worked with the team responsible for experiences regarding search, upload and machine learning.

        <p class="mt-6 text-lg text-zinc-700">Each onboarding involved way too many calls with IT departments and
            fetching data from odd corners of the customer's existing file system. Our operations team then manually
            annotated their files using old (rather scrappy) internal tools. Scalable? Nah.

            users) and the custumer (external users). Our operations team ensure that the platform was populated with
            high quality data. They were also responsible for selecting the training data set for our
            algorithms. The custumer on the other hand wants to get their documents on the platform with
            as little effort as possible.

        <p class="mt-6 pl-1 text-lg text-zinc-700"> Auto-tagging had still too much uncertainty to
            be added by default.
            Therefore, I exprimented with a more manual auto-fill option and uncertainty indications. However,
            after collaborating with developers we relieased that tracking
            auto-tagged fields as users starts to interact with docs wouldn't be feasible at this
            stage. Therefore, we went with a softer qulity control
            on prioritized areas.

            annotating documents and performing quality control.

        <p class="mt-8 text-lg leading-7 text-zinc-700">I tried many different approaches on how to get developer
            feedback thorught the project. From using straw man mocks, to async video Q&A's and co-creation.

            Something I really realised during this project is that <b class="text-gray-900">negotiation is part of the
                collaboration</b>. <br><br>
            Two sentences I found extra useful when negotiating with tech: <br><br> <i
                class="text-violet-700 font-medium">“If we *whatever tech tries to descope*,
                that will affect the experience by x, y, z” </i> <br><br>
            Bringing awareness to the consequences so that the team can make informed decisions.
            <br><br>
            <i class="text-violet-700 font-medium"> “How much work would it require to allow for x?”</i><br><br>
            Time is money, and sometimes a minor improvement in the experience is not worth days of development. Also,
            it’s nice to show that you are mindful of other people’s time.
            <br><br> Finally, I try really hard to <b class="text-gray-900">don’t dismiss other people’s ideas until
                I’ve tried them</b>. The designs I’m most proud of so far have often been a mash-up of
            ideas from the entire product team. Although some ideas might not seem 🚀🌟🎂😻 at first glance, they
            sometimes turn into the best solutions.
